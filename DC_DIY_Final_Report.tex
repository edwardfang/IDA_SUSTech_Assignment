\begin{abstract}
   In these experiments, three basic methods of data analysis are implemented, which is Principle Components Anaylysis (PCA), Clustering and Self-organizing Map (SOM). By applying there methods, the relations among different attributes are discussed. After the dimension reduction, it was found that the attributes can be predicted by others to some extent, while some can not. The relations will be presented mostly as different firgures.
